Metal kids deserve credit cards too

Daily UI #2. Requisition was for creating a full credit card payment form, however upon beginning the project, I thought it would be silly to alter the parameters in a way that marketed a new credit card to metal kids. I am still learning how to manipulate containers with regards to creating reactive pages.
